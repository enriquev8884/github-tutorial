## Git vs. GitHub
###Git: _Version control: Keeps "snapshots" of code_
* Does not require Github
* Used to :  
 * edit files
 * add files
 * commit them  

###Github:
* stores code in a cloud _(github.com)_
* able to tracks changes
* easily collaborate on files
* requires git 
* runs in the command line
